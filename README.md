# Box2d Web

A collection of demos for the [Pixel Lab](http://thinkpixellab.com) Box2d port.

### To get it running on our machine
* Clone the project locally
  * `git clone git://github.com/thinkpixellab/box2dWeb.git`
* Make sure you sync all of the git submodules.
  * `git submodule update --init`
* You'll likely want to have a static web server running out of the root directory.
  * The files are in place to make [Rack](http://rack.rubyforge.org/) and [Bundler](http://gembundler.com/) happy.
* If you want to compile the code, you'll probably want to install [kbuild](https://github.com/kevmoo/kbuild).

### Notes
* [Visit the demo web site](http://box2d.thinkpixellab.com) to see how it works.
* Check out the [Box2d code](https://github.com/thinkpixellab/pl/tree/master/src/box2d) on Github.
